   Own **1,000,000 $PNL** tokens in your Solana wallet to join

2. **Join the Competition** — Two Methods Available:

   **Method 1: Connect Wallet (Recommended)**
   - Connect your Phantom wallet
   - Choose a custom display name
   - Sign the authentication message
   - Instant access to edit your profile and stats
   - That's it! You're in for the current 24-hour season

   **Method 2: Paste Any Address**
   - Click "Paste Address" tab
   - Enter any Solana wallet address (your own or someone else's)
   - No wallet connection needed
   - Anonymous entry with auto-generated name (first 4 characters)
   - Perfect for:

     - Adding friends/other traders to the competition
     - Bulk registrations
     - Using cold storage wallets

   > **Note**: Only wallets registered via Method 1 (wallet connect) can edit their name and access full profile features. Anonymous entries are read-only.
